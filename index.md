Colonies of Man is a science fiction tabletop roleplaying game for 1-4 players. The players are tasked with managing a human colony on an unexplored world somewhere in the Milky Way. 

As colony administrators, the players must explore their surroundings, expand their colony and exploit the natural resources available to them. 

The realities of colony management are complex. Faced with limited resources, each administrator must balance their own agenda with that of the Colony. Collaboration with the other administrators is essential, but collaboration always has consequences.

Your world is remote but you are not alone in the universe. Backed by a shadowy sponsor with near unlimited resources, you have a lifeline available to you. Terms of sponsorship can be as cruel as they are kind and help is rarely given for free. Each Administrator must consider whether they can -- and will -- pay the price. 

With hard work and preparation your colony may survive. With diligence, skill and a little luck it may even survive long enough to become successful. In mankindâ€™s race across the galaxy, what will your legacy be?
